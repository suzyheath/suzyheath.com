    <p>A collection of books that I've read lately. I'll do my best to make some notes about each title, although they'll remain far from a formal review and will try more to capture my impression of the work at best, and be actually word-spat notes at worst. I've not yet practiced sitting and reflecting after finishing each read, so I imagine neither my approach nor observations will be particularly sophisticated. I hope that through the practice of keeping records here, I will improve at reflecting on the books I read.</p><p>Also, being brief, my impressions are going to be horribly unbalanced and likely extremely unfair. Take them as the first statement in a conversation and get in touch to guide me round the corner to a more seeing view!</p>

            <!-- <p>I enjoyed <em>Middle England</em>. It's described as a comedy, which is a type of novel I'd not say I've read much. It really did make me laugh, the humour was sometimes dry and ironic, while at other times it struck more sensitive chords. The novel really tapped into modern British life; many of the scenes and locales were brought vividly to life in my mind through familiarity. The most familiar was the distance Coe demonstrates between the socioeconomic strata in the UK. He does a fantastic job of portraying all the points of views of the different characters with empathy, and the resulting feeling from finishing the novel was that the divisions we hear about in the country are nobody on the ground's fault, but we can have an individual impact on healing them.</p> -->

            <p>I enjoyed <em>Middle England</em>. It's described as a comedy, which is a type of novel I'd not say I've read much. It really did make me laugh, the humour was sometimes dry and ironic, while at other times it struck more sensitive chords.

The most familiar was the distance Coe demonstrates between the socioeconomic strata in the UK. He does a fantastic job of portraying all the points of views of the different characters with empathy and the resulting feeling from finishing the novel was that while the divisions in the country are nobody (on the ground)'s fault, we can have an individual impact on healing them.</p>

            <h3>Before the coffee gets cold - Toshikazu Kawaguchi</h3>
            <p><em>Before The Coffee Gets Cold</em> was short and sweet. I enjoyed it, but don't view it as a long lasting classic. I'd not read it again. Reasoning - the morals of the story are sent across a little didactic. Although, is any short story about time travel ever not going to involve repentance, absolution, final wishes and goodbyes? I found the ever growing rules of the cafe to be tiring and not very funny, despite I think its delivery trickled through the novel being designed as a quirk. Instead that reminded me of a poorly planned essay, dropping in useful ultimata whenever a hole yawned into the argument. Luckily it isn't an undergrad essay. To give <em>Before The Coffee Gets Cold</em> some deserved credit - it was an emotive, involving read. I couldn't read fast enough. My eyes were whizzing ahead before I'd even checked out all the words of the sentence I was supposed to be reading. Kawaguchi is a very moving storyteller, conveying great emotion and action through pared back writing. However, my personal taste is for novels with a bit more tangle.</p>

          <li><h3>Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki</h3>
            <p>Obvi this isn't going to get a big review. Very easy and quick to read. Very inspiring even though money-making for moneymaking's sake isn't up my values alley. I like the idea of using gained financial literacy to get out of working your whole life per hour, and a gentle increasing rate. Unfortunately, there's not anough resources in the world to pay everyone disproportionately to the work that they do, the value that they are as a person (aka enormous and equal to most other people). Further, if everyone used their money to earn silly money for free, what would we even spend that shit on. Rubber ducks would cost a grand a pop. So, lovely and inspiring, good to know, but realistically I'm not going to become a self-righteous middle-aged man with a Porsche anytime soon (I hope).</p>

            <h3>The Waves - Virginia Woolf</h3>
            <p>Poetry! This is the first Virginia Woolf I've ever read. Out of contrariness, I never read The Bell Jar or To The Lighthouse, as apparently all other moping teenage girls do while waiting for their UCAS applications to write themselves. I don't regret being so stubborn, because now I've broked the Woolf seal I can read all her work to my heart's content starting now. She must have had different wires between her eyes and brain than the rest of us. Some of the observations were so absolutely right and yet completely original that I was blown away. The repeated image of the waves stamping on the shores lent the novel a palpable rhythm. Although it was slow reading at times, the jump in years to follow the characters as they aged was marked so subtly and with such grace that each one renewed the energy of the novel. I liked the characters, they were all distinct. The book touched nerves as it drew on several places familiar to me. I found it poignant and understated. It's now back in the libary like the rest of these I'm reviewing this evening, so I've not much more to say other than I found this book to be really exceptional. Really valuable insight I know.</p>

            <h3>China Dream - Ma Jian</h3>
            <p>Orwellian? That's what I think it said on the blurb. I thought Orwellian too as reading, although I'd have to reread 1984 to provide a more hearty statement on their similarity. I can't remember much besides that for this one. Oh, it was extremely sad, but removed and cold at the same time. I suppose that's the point. The protagonist is doing his best to avoid thinking about the tragedies he's seen and mistakes he's made, in order to continue the charade of his life as an official of the authoritarian government. The book plays with supreme irony, as Ma Daode, the protagonist, wrestles with his hyprocrisy and continued moral failings while trying frantically to repress his past, the struggle resulting in the end in the loss of his sanity. Recommended read. Great cover designed by Ai Wei Wei. Would like to read more Ma Jian.</p>

            <h3>Blindness - Jose Saramago</h3>
            <p>Very grim, a difficult read at times. Extremely sensitively portrayed characters. Again, like Before The Coffee Gets Cold, I don't like being told what to think at the end of a novel. Spoiler - this one is 'maybe we don't need eyes to see goodness' or something along those lines. After 200 pages of being terrified I expected a bit more. That said, I read it maybe 3 months ago and have a feeling I just chatted shit.</p>

            <h3>Akira - Katsuhiro Otomo</h3>
            <p>Fantastic, obviously. Akira caused me to get on the wrong train, miss the stop that'd let me change to the right train and get invited to a comicon by some weird dudes on my retraced odyssey back. So gripping. The first mega manga I've read. I've watched a solid stack of anime in my time and read a small amount of manga, but this elite material blew me away. See also - Delete Beach installation at HAU Berlin - From The New World anime (oh shit, just saw it's orginially a novel!) for more visually beautiful dystopian work.</p>
