      <H1 class="title">About</H1>
      <p>I bought this domain in Autumn 2019, after which I was accepted onto level 1 of Code First:Girls - Introduction to Front End. I really enjoyed and was challenged by this course, buoyed up by the fact that our group won the project challenge that rounded off eight weeks of fat learning curve.</p>
      <p>To keep my HTML and CSS from rusting, I decided to hand-code this site.</p>
      <p>Inspiration for this particular project came from getting sick of the million places I keep track of books I've read. Otherwise I forget I've read them! And buy or borrow them again.</p>
      <p>I thought an online record would be a nice way to anchor my list.</p>
      <p>Additionally, after reading a few books over summer, I realised that I missed the exercise of thinking in depth about what I read, something that has fallen by the wayside with my departure from a literature-based German degree into being a bog stan working person.</p>
      <p>Ideally the coding project guise will kindle latent interest in reviewing some books.</p>
      <p>Keep tabs on how it's going, and to any rogue visitors who find this mess - any feedback at all is appreciated! Dodgy code, shit processes, organisation tips... Let me know.</p>
